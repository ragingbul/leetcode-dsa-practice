    "Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, meaning the last element inserted is the first one to be removed. Elements are added using the push (append) operation and removed using the pop operation, and only the top element can be accessed at any time. In Python, a stack is usually implemented using a list. Stacks are commonly used in problems like valid parentheses checking, undo/redo operations, recursion, and expression evaluation, because they help track the most recently processed element."
